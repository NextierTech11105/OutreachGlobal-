## CLIENT ACQUISITION FORMULA

### **The Atomic Outreach Loop**
```
1. IMPORT LEADS → /admin/data/import (50/day)
   ↓
2. SKIP TRACE → Auto-enrich phone numbers
   ↓
3. SEGMENT → Tag by industry/deal size
   ↓
4. CAMPAIGN → /admin/campaign-builder (100/day)
   ↓
5. MONITOR → /admin/inbound-processing (3x/day)
   ↓
6. RESPOND → Within 5 minutes (hot leads)
   ↓
7. BOOK → Calendar link in response
   ↓
8. CLOSE → Move to /admin/companies pipeline
   ↓
9. REPEAT → Every single day
```

**Math:**
- 100 sends/day × 7 days = 700 sends/week
- 7% response rate = 49 responses
- 20% booking rate = 10 meetings
- 30% close rate = 3 deals
- $5K average deal = $15K/week

**Identity:** "I run this loop daily without thinking."

## DAILY AFFIRMATIONS (Identity Reinforcement)

"I am someone who:
- Sends campaigns daily
- Responds to leads instantly
- Books meetings consistently
- Closes deals predictably"

**Evening (after logging stats):**
"Today I:
- Executed my system
- Made progress
- Stayed consistent
- Moved closer to my goal"

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### **When Response Rate Drops:**
1. Check message templates → Too salesy?
2. Test new segments → Wrong audience?
3. Review send times → Bad timing?
4. A/B test new hooks → Message stale?

### **When Meetings Don't Convert:**
1. Record calls → Listen for objections
2. Tighten qualification → Booking wrong people?
3. Improve demo → Not showing value?
4. Follow up faster → Losing momentum?

### **When You Break the Streak:**
1. Don't judge yourself
2. Start again tomorrow
3. Identity stays the same
4. One bad day ≠ bad person

## THE ULTIMATE RULE

**"Never miss twice."**

Miss one day? Life happens.
Miss two days? Pattern forming.

**Get back on track TODAY.**
