## 🚨 CRITICAL UI/UX PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Navigation Spiral
- **Problem**: Users need to click through 5+ sections to complete one task
- **Example**: Create campaign → Setup AI → Configure integrations → Set templates → Launch
- **Impact**: Cognitive overload, user frustration, task abandonment

### 2. Data Silos
- **Problem**: Same data managed in multiple locations
- **Example**: Lead data in Lead Generation, Campaign Management, and Reporting
- **Impact**: Data inconsistency, duplicate work, confusion

### 3. Feature Overlap
- **Problem**: Similar features scattered across sections
- **Example**: Templates in Outreach, Integrations, and Campaign sections
- **Impact**: Feature discovery issues, inconsistent user experience

### 4. Workflow Disruption
- **Problem**: Natural workflows interrupted by UI structure
- **Example**: Need to leave campaign setup to configure AI agent
- **Impact**: Task switching overhead, context loss

### 5. Status Visibility Gap
- **Problem**: Important status information buried in sub-sections
- **Example**: API failures not visible on main dashboard
- **Impact**: Delayed problem detection, reactive rather than proactive
