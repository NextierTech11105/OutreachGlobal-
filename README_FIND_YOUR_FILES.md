  - `leads/fdaily/` — FDaily leads
  - `leads/manual/` — Manually added leads
  - `leads/batches/` — Lead batches

## 2. Campaigns
- All campaign blocks are in the `campaigns/` folder.

## 3. Batches
- All batch files/logs are in the `batches/` folder.

## 4. Integrations
- Zoho integration scripts/docs are in `integrations/zoho/`

## 5. Templates

**Tips:**
- Use the VS Code Explorer sidebar and expand these folders to see everything at a glance.
- Use the search bar (Ctrl+P or Ctrl+Shift+F) to instantly find any file.
- If you want a dashboard or script to list all your CSVs and leads in one place, just ask!

Stay organized and never lose a file again!
