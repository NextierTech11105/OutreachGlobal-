## CAMPAIGN 1: Low Volume Mixed (Primary - Cold Outreach)

### Use Case Type
`Low Volume Mixed`

### Campaign Description (Copy this exactly)
```
NEXTIER initiates one-to-one conversational outreach to business owners identified through professional directories and public business records. Initial messages are permission-based questions, not promotional content. All messaging is advisory in nature. Subsequent messages are only sent after recipient response. No automated marketing broadcasts.
```

### Sample Messages (Copy all 5)

**Sample 1:**
```
{firstName} - Gianna from Nextier. Honest question: does the business run clean, or because you're everywhere all the time?
```

**Sample 2:**
```
{firstName}, Gianna here. One question: how much of your week goes to doing the work vs. chasing it?
```

**Sample 3:**
```
{firstName} - Gianna with Nextier. Got something I think you'd find interesting. Worth 2 mins of your time?
```

**Sample 4:**
```
Great to hear from you {firstName}. I can share more via email if you want - just drop your best address.
```

**Sample 5:**
```
{firstName}, Gianna here. If now's not a good time, just let me know and I'll back off. No pressure.
```

### Message Flow / Opt-In Description
```
Consumers provide consent through professional directories, business listings, and opt-in forms on nextier.signalhouse.io. The initial message asks a permission-based question or requests consent to continue. Subsequent messages are only sent after the consumer responds. This is one-to-one conversational outreach, not marketing broadcasts. Reply HELP for assistance, STOP to opt out at any time.

## WHY THIS WILL PASS

### Previous Campaign (Rejected)
- **Use Case:** Marketing
- **Description:** "Send first-party Marketing messages..."
- **Problem:** Messages were conversational, not promotional → Mismatch

### New Campaigns (Should Pass)
- **Use Case:** Low Volume Mixed / Conversational
- **Description:** Clearly states "permission-based," "advisory," "non-promotional"
- **Messages:** Ask questions, seek permission, no hype
- **Flow:** Clearly explains two-way dialogue only

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Old (Rejected) | New (Should Pass) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Use Case | Marketing | Low Volume Mixed |
| Description | "Marketing messages" | "Permission-based questions" |
| Tone | Promotional implication | Advisory/conversational |
| Message Style | Value offers | Questions only |
| Opt-out | Missing context | Clear at campaign level |
